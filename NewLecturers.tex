There are a number of discipline level challenges well documented within Computer Science Education. Failure rates can be high, learning programming for the first time remains a significant hurdle~\cite{davenport-et-al:latice2016,murphy-et-al:programming2017,simon-et-al:sigcse2018}, with a range of issues impacting failure rates~\cite{Watson:2014:FRI:2591708.2591749}. Student satisfaction as measured by satisfaction surveys is reported as commonly below that of other disciplines \cite{Sinclair2015}. Challenges related to the employment prospects of graduates have been reported as inferior to other disciplines\cite{shadbolt2016shadbolt}. Effectively addressing these pedagogic challenges involves a number of sophisticated and evolving pedagogic approaches. To be an adept Computer Science academic requires maintaining currency in terms of specialist subject knowledge but also fluency in how to respond to the pedagogic challenges the discipline presents.

The complex and contested demands of learning and teaching in UK\&I higher education make the early career of an academic challenging ~\cite{Thomas2015} and potentially lonely ~\cite{Foote2009}, especially when balanced against their research aspirations, and wider professional service commitments. Learning and teaching development in the UK commonly involves working towards Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy~\cite{fellowship} (now known as AdvanceHE), either by direct application or by an accredited university postgraduate course. Typically, this is supported by mentoring from within a department. The quality of learning provided will be promoted in part by the strength of the community of practice operating within the department~\cite{Bolander2008} and the communities of practice that exist at a national and international level~\cite{Thomas2015}.

Together, the challenges of the teaching the discipline and the challenges of learning to become an effective academic can be fraught. This paper summaries an initiative to date to explore the potential to supplement the existing initiatives with further national level training and development opportunities.

It has been reported the the most commonly employed mechanism for continuing professional development (CPD) is conversations between peers \cite{King2004} . A number of communities exist to support these conversations at the local, national and international level.  Internationally this development is supported by the groupings such as ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (ACM SIGCSE) \cite{SIGCSE} or the IEEE Education Society \cite{IEEEES}.  These organisations run a number of conferences to promote discussion and dialog as well as dissemination of ideas. In the UK and Ireland a chapter of SIGCSE \cite{UKI-SIGCSE} further promotes these discussions by running a computer education practice conference (CEP) conference \cite{CEP} and a computing education research conference \cite{UKICER}. As an addition to the CEP conference is a workshop designed to help welcome new people to the community. Conversations are also promoted by the Raspberry PI Foundation via it Symposium \cite{PI_SYM} and online seminars \cite{PI_Sem}. However whilst new Faculty are welcome to attend the conferences and seminars are directly aimed a the needs of New Faculty members who may in any case find it challenging to find funding for attendance. The ACM SIGCSE chapter also holds twitter meets and runs has a journal club. Whilst New Faculty are welcome to join in these discussions, they are not really aimed at their needs.  Some universities have centres which further promote these conversations for example Edinburgh Napier Centre for Computer Education Research \cite{Napier}. However far from all Universities in the United Kingdom have dedicated centres such as this. In summary the International and National Initiatives help promote a community that experienced academics can access to provide CPD, however the CPD for New Faculty is less developed particularly for those at Universities who do not have CSE research groups or centres.

In addition to training programmes run by individual Universities, in the UK, the Higher Education Academy (HEA) runs training programmes for academics at different stages of their career \cite{HEATraining}. However this training is not discipline specific. The Council of Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC) run occasional workshops in a variety of issues. The most pertinent offering for new Faculty has been the Chair in 10 Years workshop which is aimed at facilitating career planning. Whilst this is a well received contribution, it does not directly support the development needs of new Faculty with respect of pedagogy.

As well as generic pedagogic challenges, most disciplines including computer science have a range of discipline specific challenges. The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) for a number of years has ran a training course intended to welcome new faculty to the community and help address key discipline related pedagogic challenges \cite{IMA}.

For a number of years  mentoring has been recognised as a important mechanism in the development of academics. Clearly mentoring can be formal and informal. Formal mentoring problems are now common as part of the process of on boarding new Faculty members.  Commonly this takes the form of a senior academic mentoring a new Faculty member. While such mechanisms can be very effective, limiting guidance and support to one source rather than a community can be limiting \cite{deJanasz}. This suggests that mentoring across the community could be of benefit.  Informal mentoring can also be very effective but it is not without issue. For example it has been reported that women can feel marginalised from informal mentoring partnerships \cite{gibson2006mentoring}.  Given the diversity of New Faculty in the United Kingdom this suggests adopting a more formal approach to cross institute mentoring may be beneficial.

\begin{abstract}
The early career of a computer science academic in the United Kingdom (UK) — as with most other disciplines — is challenging in terms of balancing research aspirations, learning and teaching responsibilities, wider academic service commitments, as well as their own professional development. In terms of learning and teaching development, this commonly involves working towards Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (now known as Advance HE), either by direct application or via successful completion of an accredited institutional taught postgraduate course. Typically, if a course is required (often as part of their academic probation), the focus will be general higher education learning and teaching pedagogy rather than specifically focused on computer science and cognate areas. The formal institutional course requirements are normally supplemented by mentoring from within their department from experienced academic colleagues. Thus, the quality of development for an early-career academic will be enhanced in part by the strength of the community of practice operating within the department and the communities of practice that exist at a national and international level, often through professional bodies, learned societies and sub-disciplinary groupings. This paper explores the work-in-progress to address some of these structural, cultural and community challenges at both the institutional and national level in the UK, based on empirical themes collected from a workshop help at a recent UK computer science education research conference. We identify a number of specific actions and recommendations to supplement the current formal institutional requirements with enhanced national-level academic practice support and professional development, alongside local and regional professional mentoring.

\section{What is it?}	
%%A short description of the practice you're presenting
This paper explores the work-in-progress to address some of these structural, cultural and community challenges at both the institutional and national level in the UK, based on empirical themes collected from a workshop help at a recent UK computer science education research conference. It presents a progress report from a project exploring, developing and delivering an initiative to supplement the University based professional development training available to early-career academics and those new to teaching computer science in the UK, with National activities. It describes the work undertaken to date to research, design and develop a training course for those new to teaching Computer Science in the United Kingdom. 

This initiative began via discussions regarding how the computer science education community could be better supported at \textanon{BCS Academy of Computing Board}{BLINDED} \citeanon{BCSAcademy} and \textanon{Institute of Coding}{BLINDED} \citeanon{IOC}. This was followed by the recruitment of a steering group of academics. This is formed of academics from a wide range of Universities in the UK. The experience of the academics involved is varied. It includes junior academics to more senior academics as well as a number of members of the professoriate and senior members of \textanon{BCS Academy of Computing}{BLINDED}\citeanon{BCSAcademy}. The group includes several academics who have been recognised as National Teaching Fellows by Advanced HE \cite{AdvancedHENTF}. The views of this steering committee were combined with the outcomes of a workshop at the \textanon{ACM UK and Ireland Computing Education Research Conference 2021}{BLINDED Location} \citeanon{ACMUKICER}, to formulate a pilot training course. The training course will be first run in December 2020, so initial progress can be shared at this conference. This paper presents the outcomes from the workshop and an overview of the design of the trial run of the training programme.

\section{Why are you doing it?}
%%What happened before? What is it changing / replacing / improving? What gap is it filling?
There are a number of discipline level challenges which are well documented within Computer Science Education. Attrition and failure rates can be high, learning programming for the first time remains a significant hurdle~\cite{davenport-et-al:latice2016,murphy-et-al:programming2017,simon-et-al:sigcse2018}, with a range of issues impacting failure rates~\cite{Watson:2014:FRI:2591708.2591749}. Student satisfaction as measured by satisfaction surveys is reported as commonly below that of other disciplines \cite{Sinclair2015}. Challenges related to the employment prospects of graduates have been reported as inferior to other disciplines\cite{shadbolt2016shadbolt}. Effectively addressing these subject challenges involves a number of sophisticated and evolving pedagogic approaches. To be an adept Computer Science academic requires maintaining currency in terms of specialist subject knowledge but also fluency in how to respond to the pedagogic challenges the discipline presents.

The complex and contested demands of learning and teaching in UK\&I higher education make the early career of an academic challenging ~\cite{Thomas2015} and potentially lonely ~\cite{Foote2009}, especially when balanced against their research aspirations, and wider professional service commitments. Learning and teaching development in the UK commonly involves working towards Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy~\cite{fellowship} (now known as AdvanceHE), either by direct application or by an accredited university postgraduate course. Typically, this is supported by mentoring from within a department. The quality of learning provided will be promoted in part by the strength of the community of practice operating within the department~\cite{Bolander2008} and the communities of practice that exist at a national and international level~\cite{Thomas2015}.

Together, the challenges of the teaching the discipline and the challenges of learning to become an effective academic can be fraught. However mechanisms do exist to support this transition. For a number of years  mentoring has been recognised as a important mechanism in the development of academics. Clearly mentoring can be formal and informal. Formal mentoring problems are now common as part of the process of on boarding early-career academics.  Commonly this takes the form of an experienced academic mentoring a early-career colleague. Mentoring has been highlighted as part of a set of activities help diversify the staff base \cite{Golubchik2018}.While such mechanisms can be very effective, limiting guidance and support to one source rather than a community can be limiting \cite{deJanasz}. This suggests that mentoring across the community could be of benefit.  Informal mentoring can also be very effective but it is not without issue. For example it has been reported that women can feel marginalised from informal mentoring partnerships \cite{gibson2006mentoring}.   In the UK, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues are \textit{''poorly represented in both senior academic and university leadership roles: of 19,000 people employed as professors in the United Kingdom, only 400 are BAME women. In a typical gathering of 100 professors, 90 would be white and there would be just two BAME women.''} \cite[p.~I]{UniversitiesUK19}. There are a plethora of issues that continue to reinforce aspects of this of this inequality \cite{arday20}. Policy recommendations have been made (including mentoring and the establishing of support networks) \cite{bhopal2014experiences}, and initiatives developed and executed (including Athena Swan \cite{AthenaSwan} and Race Equality Charter (REC)  \cite{REC}. Equally research suggests that care needs to be taken not to conflate issues of race and gender \cite{Bhopal19} or uncomfortable truths may be avoided. Research related to cross-gender or cross-racial mentoring is relatively rare, however it has been reported that cross-racial mentoring between faculty and students can work \cite{reddick2016don} if the ally development model is employed. Clearly ally work is challenging and will require continual reflection, perseverance and careful consideration of power and positions in response to repression \cite{Patton2015}. However the distance and absence of direct power structures between universities may make it more straightforward to function as an ally in a cross-university mentoring relationship which is unburdened by managerial or organisational concerns. Such mentoring relationships are also likely to be educational for the mentors.

This paper summaries an initiative to date to explore the potential to supplement the existing initiatives with further national level training and development opportunities.

\section{Where does it fit?}
%%A short description of your teaching context. You may, for instance, include a description of intake, class size, curriculum sequence; anything that's necessary for others to understand your situation. How do things work at your institution?
In the UK, early-career academics have had varied prior experience including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Post Docs taking up their first academic appointment at the start of their academic career.
\item Postdocs who are helping out with teaching as part of their career development in preparation for applying for an academic position.
\item PhD students, aspiring to an academic career, and with significant teaching responsibilities.
\item Established Academics (international) new to the UK HE sector.
\item Junior academics who have been in their temporary post for a few years.
\item Those transitioning from FE or College into their first HE job.
\item Those transitioning from industry into their first HE job.
\item CS lecturers at HEIs who don’t currently specify that their lecturing staff undertake  a Postgraduate Qualification
\end{itemize}

In any given year, the number of individuals in this position will vary. However in most intuitions, in any given year there is usually at-least one faculty member in this position and there are over one hundred Higher Education Intuitions in the UK that teaching computing. As such there is not an insignificant number of individuals who could benefit from the training.

\textbf{TO DO: - is this true}
For the pilot training course will be run for early-career academics based at the Universities of those who form the steering committee. The Pilot will run in December 2020. The training programme, follows a blended approach consisting of live online sessions supported with the availability of the material on a supporting website. The programming includes live virtual sessions presented by colleagues from Computer Science Departments across the HEI community. The sessions will be practical in focus and include sharing of practice highlight, recognised good practice and sharing of mistakes made / pitfalls to avoid. The intention is to supplement the programme, with the offer of cross-institution mentoring.
\textbf{TO DO: - is this true}

\section{Does it work?}	
%%How do you know? Give some evidence of effectiveness in context.

%% Comment from AI - Worth emphasising  that the sub sections in 4 are as a result of the workshop ? Have we ranked them based on number of responses and / or discussion ???Maybe worth saying that there were xxxx post it responses and we identified key themes ?? Worth saying that Tom P facilitated the data gathering and encouraged discussion of common points ?? (action research ?? )
The workshop  at the \textanon{ACM UK and Ireland Computing Education Research Conference 2021}{BLINDED Location} \citeanon{ACMUKICER}, focused upon addressing three research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What current and future opportunities are there to engage new CS Faculty with the UK and Ireland Computer Science Education Community of Practice?
\item What is the potential to supplement institutional academic / research development opportunities with national development opportunities?
\item How can we continue to raise the profile and value of new research faculty members engaging with Computer Science Education Research?
\end{enumerate}
The input from the 21 attendees generated a number of fascinating insights into challenges new Faculty Members face. Key Themes that emerged include:

\subsection{Islands of excellence}
There are a number of intuitions within the UK with significant research interests in computer science education (for example: \textanon{Glasgow, Kent, Lancaster Napier}{BLAH,BLAH,BLAH}). Other institutions lacked such support. It was suggested that in some cases further collaboration with Education departments may also be of benefit. Elsewhere, some colleagues reported the absence of Computer Science Education Research Groups and the related infrastructure to promote the importance of computer science education
\subsection{Competing priorities / Resource constraints}
Balancing alternative pressures came out strongly as a key challenge in raising interest in computer science education. Hence any training course has to be designed with direct benefit for attendees. 
\subsection{Variable University level support}
Variable university level support was identified. Some colleagues reporting little support New Faculty with respect to learning and teaching. Other reporting postgraduate training programmes or even Higher Apprenticeships.
\subsection{Local and other initiatives}
A number of local initiatives exist, together with a growing number of national initiatives (as discussed in the next section.) This suggests the appetite for initiatives such as this one.
\subsection{The community}
The national Computer Science Education Community was seen as a very positive development and further initiatives that intended to strengthen or grow the community appeared to be well received.
\subsection{Marketing / perception}
A few participants commented less favourable regarding how Computer Science Education was seen in their home universities, together with a wish to support initiatives the raised its profile and perceived value. 

\section{Who else has done this?}
%%Where did you get the idea from? (If from published reports, please include references). How did you find out about it? Was it easy/hard to adopt? What did you change?

It has been reported the the most commonly employed mechanism for continuing professional development (CPD) is conversations between peers \cite{King2004} . A number of communities exist to support these conversations at the local, national and international level.  Internationally this development is supported by the groupings such as ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (ACM SIGCSE) \cite{SIGCSE} or the IEEE Education Society \cite{IEEEES}.  These organisations run a number of conferences to promote discussion and dialog as well as dissemination of ideas. In the UK and Ireland a chapter of SIGCSE \cite{UKI-SIGCSE} further promotes these discussions by running a computer education practice conference (CEP) conference \cite{CEP} and a computing education research conference \cite{UKICER}. As an addition to the CEP conference is a workshop designed to help welcome new people to the community. Conversations are also promoted by the Raspberry PI Foundation via it Symposium \cite{PI_SYM} and online seminars \cite{PI_Sem}. However whilst early-career academics are welcome to attend the conferences and seminars are not directly aimed a the needs of early-career academics who may in any case find it challenging to find funding for attendance. The ACM SIGCSE chapter also holds twitter meets and runs a journal club. Whilst early-career academics are welcome to join in these discussions, they are not really aimed at their needs.  Some universities have centres which further promote these conversations for example Edinburgh Napier Centre for Computer Education Research \cite{Napier}. However far from all Universities in the United Kingdom have dedicated centres such as this. In summary the International and National Initiatives help promote a community that experienced academics can access to provide CPD, however the CPD for early-career academics is less developed particularly for those at Universities who do not have CSE research groups or centres.

In addition to training programmes run by individual Universities, in the UK, the Higher Education Academy (HEA) runs training programmes for academics at different stages of their career \cite{HEATraining}. However this training is not discipline specific. The Council of Professors and Heads of Computing (CPHC) run occasional workshops in a variety of issues. The most pertinent offering for new Faculty has been the Chair in 10 Years workshop which is aimed at facilitating career planning. Whilst this is a well received contribution, it does not directly support the development needs of new Faculty with respect of pedagogy.

As well as generic pedagogic challenges, most disciplines including computer science have a range of discipline specific challenges. The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) for a number of years has ran a training course intended to welcome new faculty to the community and help address key discipline related pedagogic challenges \cite{IMA}.

\section{What will you do next?}
%%Will you vary this, or develop it further?

The analysis, highlights that there is space within the current computer science community of practice in the United Kingdom to establish a training programme for those new to computer science which supplements that provided within universities. The discussions to date have lead to the design of a training programme shown in Table \ref{tab:table1}. The programme will be delivered over five, half day blocks.

%%And maybe something about ongoing CPD – these days could be opened up to established colleagues (or is that a whole new paper). But also ongoing CPD for those new colleagues who complete the 5
%%Something back to community of practice – peer led development and WBL for academics ??

This programme will be delivered for the first time in December 2020. The initial delivery of the programme will be via a blended learning model, with attendees completing activities as well as attending a series of webinars. As part of the programme, the intentions is to offer the opportunity to establish cross university mentoring. The wider grouping of academics involved in the development of the initiative has broad learning and teaching expertise within the field of computer science. This bread of expertise will enable mentoring in the area of the attendees teaching responsibilities. The delivery will be evaluated and assuming the delivery is successful, how to make the programme more widely available will be considered with the target that such a delivery would be available subject to interest within the academic year 2020/21. The blended learning approach may prove to be the best approach, however as circumstances in the UK change with respect to Covid-19 \cite{Crick20}, further consideration will be given to potential alternative delivery models.

\section{Why are you telling us this?}	
%%What is interesting, or useful, about this to someone else?
The community of practice of computer science education in the UK has evolved rapidly in recent years which presents the opportunity to  review and celebrate the current achievements. As part of this review, this paper presents a further opportunity has been highlighted in the form of the establishment of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A national training programme for those new to teaching computer science in the UK, which will supplement the training and development opportunities local to each university
\item A national mentoring programme for those new to teaching computer science in the UK
\end{enumerate}
These parallel initiatives are intended to adopt the ally model which is facilitated by the cross university nature of the initiative. In doing so as well as supporting the developing of computer science pedagogic competencies, and  the extension of the computer science education community of practice, it is intended to provide attendees an ally who can help them address any racial and gender inequalities that continue to persist in UK Higher Education.

The initiative presents significant opportunities for those at a variety of points of their career. For those at an early career stage, the initiative presents a further source of beneficial professional development. For those with more experience, as the initiative develops so will opportunities to become involved. If the approach is effective, and the community wishes to see it extended then the involvement of experienced colleagues in its enhancement, development, delivery and as mentors will be critical to ensure access to it.
